# Spotify_analysis
This is a basic data analytics and visualization project to get some insights like 'popular genre', 'average duration in each year', etc., 
In this basic project, I used pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
Data sets used in this are gathered from kaggle.com and links for those data sets are available below.
